## PixiJS Game Fixes - PAUSED FOR RESEARCH PHASE

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL STATUS: WORK PAUSED

**Current State**: Development paused due to **compilation errors** and **incorrect implementation approach**

**Reason for Pause**: Attempting to fix PixiJS implementation without understanding correct game specifications from main branch (Fabric.js version)

---

## 📋 Problem Analysis Summary

### Production vs Development Comparison

| Aspect | Production (Working) | Development (Broken) | Status |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Space Key** | Game start only | Manual jumping | ❌ Wrong behavior |
| **Auto Jumping** | Every ~1 second | None | ❌ Missing feature |
| **Arrow Keys** | Player movement | No response | ❌ Not working |
| **Timer** | 10 seconds (JSON) | 20 seconds (default) | ❌ JSON not loading |
| **Player Visual** | White dot | Green circle | ❌ Wrong appearance |
| **Camera** | Follows player | Fixed position | ❌ No tracking |
| **Collision** | Platform collision | Falls through | ❌ Broken physics |

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Specification Gap**: Don't understand what the game should actually do
2. **Implementation Mismatch**: PixiJS version doesn't match Fabric.js behavior  
3. **Missing Features**: Target cursor (× marker) system completely missing
4. **Architecture Issues**: Double rendering, broken event handling

---

## 🔧 Attempted Fixes (INCOMPLETE)

### ✅ Partially Completed
- **Auto-jump System**: Added automatic jumping every 60 frames
- **Player Visual**: Changed green circle → white dot, removed double rendering
- **Camera Tracking**: Added smooth following with lerp interpolation  
- **UI Updates**: Added timer/score updates in game loop

### ❌ Critical Compilation Errors
```typescript
// PurePixiGame.ts:432 - Variable declaration missing
newVy = JUMP_FORCE; // ❌ ReferenceError: newVy is not defined
```

### ❌ Missing Core Features
- **Target Cursor**: Player chase target (× marker) - completely missing
- **Death Markers**: Death location markers - not implemented
- **JSON Loading**: Development server not reading stage1.json properly
- **Collision System**: Platform collision detection broken

## 📂 Modified Files Status

### Files with Changes (BROKEN)
```
src/core/PurePixiGame.ts          - Auto-jump + camera + UI (HAS ERRORS)
src/systems/PixiRenderSystem.ts   - Player visual fixes  
src/core/PixiGameState.ts         - Disabled duplicate player rendering
```

### Test Status
- **Previous**: 42/42 tests passing ✅
- **Current**: Compilation broken ❌
- **Coverage**: Maintained standards before errors

---

## 🎯 MANDATORY NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Research and Documentation (REQUIRED)
1. **Switch to Main Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Study Fabric.js Implementation**
   - Analyze main branch thoroughly
   - Focus on game mechanics, NOT implementation details
   - Document WHAT the game does, not HOW

3. **Create Game Specification Document**
   - Player movement system (exact behavior)
   - Auto-jumping mechanics (timing, triggers)
   - Target cursor system (× marker behavior) 
   - Death marker system (placement, persistence)
   - Collision detection (exact rules)
   - Camera following (smoothing, constraints)
   - Timing system (stage limits, scoring)
   - Visual specifications (colors, sizes)

### Phase 2: Clean PixiJS Implementation
- Build from verified specifications
- No guessing about game mechanics
- Match production behavior exactly

## 🔍 Research Questions to Answer

### Critical Game Mechanics
1. **Auto-jumping**: Timer-based (60 frames) or event-triggered?
2. **Target Cursor**: What is the × marker the player chases? Where does it appear?
3. **Player Goal**: Chase cursor, reach goal, or follow predetermined path?
4. **Death System**: When do death markers (×) appear? How long do they persist?
5. **Movement Physics**: Exact gravity, speed, acceleration values
6. **Collision Detection**: Line-segment collision or pixel-perfect?
7. **Camera Behavior**: Immediate following or smooth interpolation?
8. **Stage Loading**: Why isn't JSON loading in development?

### Technical Specifications Needed
- Exact timing values (jump intervals, camera smoothing)
- Visual specifications (player size, colors, UI layout)
- Physics constants (gravity, speed limits, friction)
- Collision detection algorithms
- Score calculation formulas

## 🎮 Game Understanding Gaps

### What We Know
- Production environment works correctly
- Space key starts game, arrows move player
- Player automatically jumps periodically
- Camera follows player smoothly
- Stage1 has 10-second time limit
- Player appears as white dot

### What We Don't Know
- **Target System**: What is player supposed to chase?
- **Death Mechanics**: How death markers work
- **Exact Timing**: Jump intervals, camera smoothing values
- **Collision Rules**: Platform detection algorithm
- **Scoring Logic**: How score is calculated
- **Stage Progression**: How levels advance

---

## 🛠️ Immediate Action Required

### Quick Fix for Compilation
```typescript
// In PurePixiGame.ts, line ~430
let newVy: number; // Add this declaration
if (player.grounded && this.jumpTimer >= AUTO_JUMP_INTERVAL) {
    newVy = JUMP_FORCE;
    // ... rest of code
}
```

### But DON'T Continue Development!
- Fix compilation error only for clean state
- **DO NOT** add more features without research
- **DO NOT** guess about game mechanics

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Next Phase

### Research Phase Complete When:
- [ ] Main branch Fabric.js implementation fully analyzed
- [ ] Game specification document created
- [ ] All game mechanics understood and documented
- [ ] Visual and timing specifications captured
- [ ] No assumptions or guesses about behavior

### Implementation Phase Ready When:
- [ ] PixiJS implementation matches production exactly
- [ ] All automatic systems working correctly  
- [ ] Zero compilation errors
- [ ] Full test coverage maintained
- [ ] Clean, maintainable codebase

## 💡 Key Insights for Next Developer

1. **Production Works**: Use https://traponion.github.io/jumping-dot-game/ as reference
2. **Main = Fabric**: Main branch contains working Fabric.js implementation to study
3. **Specification First**: Document game mechanics before coding
4. **No Guessing**: Every behavior must be verified against main branch
5. **Quality Focus**: Maintain test coverage and code standards
