## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Stages
```typescript
// Define new stage data
const customStage: StageData = {
    id: 3,
    name: 'Custom Stage',
    platforms: [
        { x1: 100, y1: 500, x2: 200, y2: 500 }
    ],
    spikes: [
        { x: 250, y: 485, width: 15, height: 15 }
    ],
    goal: { x: 400, y: 450, width: 40, height: 50 },
    startText: { x: 50, y: 550, text: 'START' },
    goalText: { x: 420, y: 430, text: 'GOAL' }
};
```
